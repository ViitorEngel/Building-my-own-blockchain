# Introduction
In this project, I'm trying to make my own blockchain for study purposes.
I'm basically following step by step [this](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46)
tutorial.

This project was really fun to make, and was great for exercising OOP and learning HTTP.

I still need to finish the consensus part of the code, though.
